		<p>I am a Lecturer IV in the School of Information at the University of Michigan. I focus on the introductory programming courses such as Data-Oriented Programming (SI 206) and the Web Design Courses (SI 339 and SI 539).</p>

		<p>My previous jobs include Associate Professor at <a href = "http://www.csulb.edu">California State University</a> and positions at NASA JPL, the Naval Research Lab, and the NSA. I received my BS from <a href = "http://www.kent.edu">Kent State University</a>Honors College in Computer Science, and an MS and PhD from the University of Pittsburgh, also in Computer Science. My thesis was on Artificial Intelligence applications on the Nursebot Project, a robotic assistant for the elderly.</p>
